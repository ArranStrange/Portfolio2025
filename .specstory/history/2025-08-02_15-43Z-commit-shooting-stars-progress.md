I can see you're on the `Shooting-stars` branch and there are several changes related to the shooting stars feature. Let me add the relevant files and commit them. I'll focus on the shooting stars related changes:


---

```bash
git add src/components/ShootingStars.tsx src/pages/HeroPage.tsx
```

```
arranstrange@MacBook-Pro-2 Portfolio 2 % git add src/components/ShootingStars.tsx src/pages/HeroPage.tsx
```

---

Now let me commit these changes with a descriptive message:


---

```bash
git commit -m "Add shooting stars animation component and integrate into HeroPage"
```

```
<ars animation component and integrate into HeroPage"

Perfect! I've successfully committed the shooting stars changes. The commit includes:

1. **`src/components/ShootingStars.tsx`** - The new shooting stars animation component (179 lines added)
2. **`src/pages/HeroPage.tsx`** - The modified HeroPage that integrates the shooting stars component

The commit message "Add shooting stars animation component and integrate into HeroPage" clearly describes what was implemented. The changes are now saved in your git history on the `Shooting-stars` branch.

Would you like me to also commit the other related changes I noticed (like the wave animations, blog components, etc.), or would you prefer to handle those separately?

my branch doesnt seem to be connected to my git hub repo

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the current git remote configuration to see if your branch is connected to your GitHub repository.


---

```bash
git remote -v
```

```
arranstrange@MacBook-Pro-2 Portfolio 2 % git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/ArranStrange/Portfolio2025.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/ArranStrange/Portfolio2025.git (push)
arranstrange@MacBook-Pro-2 Portfolio 2 %
```

---

Good! Your remote is properly configured. Now let me check if your `Shooting-stars` branch exists on the remote repository:


---

```bash
git branch -r
```

```
arranstrange@MacBook-Pro-2 Portfolio 2 % git branch -r
  origin/main
arranstrange@MacBook-Pro-2 Portfolio 2 %
```

---

I can see the issue! Your `Shooting-stars` branch exists locally but hasn't been pushed to GitHub yet. The remote only shows `origin/main`. Let me push your `Shooting-stars` branch to GitHub:


---

```bash
git push -u origin Shooting-stars
```

```
