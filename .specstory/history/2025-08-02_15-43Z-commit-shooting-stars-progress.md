I'll help you commit the changes related to the shooting stars. Let me first check the current status of your git repository to see what changes have been made.

```

---

I can see you're on the `Shooting-stars` branch and there are several changes related to the shooting stars feature. Let me add the relevant files and commit them. I'll focus on the shooting stars related changes:


---

```bash
git add src/components/ShootingStars.tsx src/pages/HeroPage.tsx
```

```
arranstrange@MacBook-Pro-2 Portfolio 2 % git add src/components/ShootingStars.tsx src/pages/HeroPage.tsx
```

---

Now let me commit these changes with a descriptive message:


---

```bash
git commit -m "Add shooting stars animation component and integrate into HeroPage"
```

```
<ars animation component and integrate into HeroPage"
[Shooting-stars e49d23c] Add shooting stars animation component and integrate into HeroPage
 2 files changed, 179 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 src/components/ShootingStars.tsx
arranstrange@MacBook-Pro-2 Portfolio 2 %
```

---

Perfect! I've successfully committed the shooting stars changes. The commit includes:

1. **`src/components/ShootingStars.tsx`** - The new shooting stars animation component (179 lines added)
2. **`src/pages/HeroPage.tsx`** - The modified HeroPage that integrates the shooting stars component

The commit message "Add shooting stars animation component and integrate into HeroPage" clearly describes what was implemented. The changes are now saved in your git history on the `Shooting-stars` branch.

Would you like me to also commit the other related changes I noticed (like the wave animations, blog components, etc.), or would you prefer to handle those separately?

_**User**_

my branch doesnt seem to be connected to my git hub repo

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the current git remote configuration to see if your branch is connected to your GitHub repository.


---

```bash
git remote -v
```

```
arranstrange@MacBook-Pro-2 Portfolio 2 % git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/ArranStrange/Portfolio2025.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/ArranStrange/Portfolio2025.git (push)
arranstrange@MacBook-Pro-2 Portfolio 2 %
```

---

Good! Your remote is properly configured. Now let me check if your `Shooting-stars` branch exists on the remote repository:


---

```bash
git branch -r
```

```
arranstrange@MacBook-Pro-2 Portfolio 2 % git branch -r
  origin/main
arranstrange@MacBook-Pro-2 Portfolio 2 %
```

---

I can see the issue! Your `Shooting-stars` branch exists locally but hasn't been pushed to GitHub yet. The remote only shows `origin/main`. Let me push your `Shooting-stars` branch to GitHub:


---

```bash
git push -u origin Shooting-stars
```

```
arranstrange@MacBook-Pro-2 Portfolio 2 % git push -u origin Shooting-stars

Perfect! Your `Shooting-stars` branch is now connected to your GitHub repository. Here's what happened:

âœ… **Successfully pushed your branch to GitHub!**

- Your `Shooting-stars` branch is now available on GitHub at: `https://github.com/ArranStrange/Portfolio2025`
- The branch is set up to track `origin/Shooting-stars` (upstream tracking)
- GitHub even provided a link to create a pull request if you want to merge it into main: `https://github.com/ArranStrange/Portfolio2025/pull/new/Shooting-stars`

Now your shooting stars feature is safely stored on GitHub and you can:
1. Continue working on the branch locally
2. Create a pull request to merge it into main when ready
3. Share the branch with others if needed

Your branch is now properly connected to your GitHub repository! ðŸŽ‰

_**User**_

why do I still have a lot of changes not commited?

---

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the current git status to see what changes are still uncommitted:


---

```bash
git status
```

```
arranstrange@MacBook-Pro-2 Portfolio 2 % git status
On branch main
Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 2 commits.

I see what happened! You're currently on the `main` branch, not the `Shooting-stars` branch. The uncommitted changes you're seeing are different files that were created during your development session. Let me check what branch you should be on:


---

```bash
git branch -a
```

```
arranstrange@MacBook-Pro-2 Portfolio 2 % git branch -a
  Shooting-stars
* main
  remotes/origin/Shooting-stars
  remotes/origin/main
arranstrange@MacBook-Pro-2 Portfolio 2 %
```

---

The issue is that you're currently on the `main` branch (indicated by the `*`), but your shooting stars work was done on the `Shooting-stars` branch. The uncommitted changes you're seeing are actually new files that were created during your development session, including:

- Blog-related components (`BlogCard.tsx`, `BlogPage.tsx`)
- Wave animations (`WaveParallax.tsx`)
- Navigation updates (`Navigation.tsx`)
- New assets (`public/Icons/`, `public/Waves/`)
- Documentation files (`.specstory/` files)

These appear to be from other features you've been working on. If you want to commit these changes, you have a few options:

1. **Switch back to the Shooting-stars branch** to continue working on that feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout Shooting-stars
   ```

2. **Commit these new changes to main** if they're ready:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add blog components, wave animations, and navigation updates"
   ```

3. **Create a new branch** for these changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b blog-and-waves-features
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add blog components, wave animations, and navigation updates"
   ```

Which approach would you prefer? The shooting stars feature is already committed and pushed to the `Shooting-stars` branch, so these uncommitted changes are separate work.

_**User**_

I've merged the shooting star one now. Lets commit this one.
