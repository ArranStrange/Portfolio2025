# Adjust hero section layout (2025-08-19 08:02Z)

_**User**_

for the hero/landing, I actually want to move the mountains to the top so it is the first thing you see, the same as the waves on the blog page. Lets also move the scroll to the lower point of the screen like the blog page. Infact, just copy the blog page but with the elements we have for the hero.

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the hero/landing section to match the blog page layout with mountains at the top and scroll at the bottom. Let me first examine the current hero section and the blog page to understand the structure.


---

Read file: src/App.tsx

---

Now let me examine the Hero component to see its current structure:


---

Read file: src/components/Hero.tsx

---

Now let me examine the BlogPage to see how it's structured with waves at the top and scroll at the bottom:


---

Read file: src/pages/BlogPage.tsx

---

Perfect! Now I can see the structure. The BlogPage has:
1. Waves at the top in a full-screen section
2. Scroll indicator at the bottom of that section
3. Content section below

I need to modify the Hero component to follow the same pattern but with mountains instead of waves. Let me update the Hero component:

Perfect! I've successfully restructured the Hero component to match the BlogPage layout. Here's what I changed:

1. **Moved mountains to the top**: The `MountainParallax` component is now in the first full-screen section, just like the waves on the blog page.

2. **Added scroll indicator at the bottom**: The scroll indicator is now positioned at the bottom of the mountain section with the same styling and behavior as the blog page.

3. **Restructured the layout**: The component now follows the same pattern as the blog page:
   - First section: Full-screen mountain parallax with scroll indicator at bottom
   - Second section: Intro text content in a full-screen section

4. **Enhanced scroll functionality**: The scroll button now smoothly scrolls to the intro text section, just like the blog page scrolls to the blog posts section.

5. **Improved styling**: Added hover effects and better positioning to match the blog page's scroll indicator.

The hero page now has the same visual flow as the blog page - users will see the mountains first, then can scroll down to see the intro text, creating a more consistent user experience across your portfolio.

_**User**_

lets move the mountains down on the screen and give them an overflow as hidden, I want the top mountain to be halfway up the screen just like the waves

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you adjust the mountain positioning to match the waves layout. Let me first examine the WaveParallax component to see how the waves are positioned, then modify the MountainParallax component accordingly.


---

Read file: src/components/WaveParallax.tsx

---

Now let me examine the MountainParallax component to see its current structure:


---

Read file: src/components/MountainParallax.tsx

---

Now I can see the difference. The waves are positioned with `flex items-center justify-center` and have a height of `75vh`, while the mountains are positioned at the bottom with `100vh` height. I need to modify the MountainParallax component to match the wave positioning. Let me update it:

Perfect! I've successfully modified the MountainParallax component to match the wave positioning. Here are the key changes I made:

1. **Added overflow hidden**: The container now has `overflow-hidden` to clip any content that goes beyond the screen boundaries.

2. **Centered positioning**: Changed from `bottom-0 left-0` positioning to `inset-0 flex items-center justify-center` to center the mountains on screen, just like the waves.

3. **Reduced height**: Changed the mountain height from `100vh` to `75vh` so the top mountain will be positioned halfway up the screen.

4. **Simplified styling**: Removed the complex absolute positioning and transform properties, using the flexbox centering approach instead.

5. **Consistent container styling**: Added the same background and width styling as the waves for consistency.

Now the mountains will be positioned exactly like the waves - centered on screen with the top mountain halfway up the screen, and any overflow will be hidden. The mountains will animate in from the bottom and settle into their final positions, creating the same visual effect as the waves on the blog page.

_**User**_

For the code present, we get this error:
```
Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'width' does not exist in type 'MountainLayer'.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

---

_**Assistant**_

I need to add the `width` property to the `MountainLayer` interface to resolve this TypeScript error.

I need the bottom mountain to be a little wider because it is showing the sides of the frame,

I'll add a width property to the bottom mountain (Mountain 6) to make it wider and prevent the frame edges from showing.

It looks like there was an issue with the edit. Let me fix this by reading the current file and making a proper correction:


---

Read file: src/components/MountainParallax.tsx

---

I can see the issues. Let me fix them:

1. The width property was added to the wrong mountain (Mountain 1 instead of Mountain 6)
2. The static mountain (Mountain 6) still uses hardcoded width
3. There are some inconsistencies in the height values


---

I'm fixing the mountain layer configurations and ensuring the width property is properly applied to the bottom mountain and used in the rendering logic.

Perfect! Now the bottom mountain (Mountain 6) has a width of "120%" which will make it wider and prevent the frame edges from showing. The width property is properly applied to both the static mountain and the animated mountains, with a fallback to "350px" if no width is specified.

_**User**_

this is good, the only issue is, the mountain pngs are shortened, I need them to stay the same length but be overflow hidden to shorten them.

I understand! You want to keep the mountain PNGs at their full height but use overflow hidden to clip them to the desired height. Let me modify the component to use the full height of the images and let the container's overflow hidden handle the clipping.

The string to replace was not found in the file.

Let me read the current file to see the exact content:


---

Read file: src/components/MountainParallax.tsx

---

Now I can see the exact content. Let me update both image elements to use full height so the overflow hidden will clip them:

Perfect! Now the mountain images will maintain their full height (100vh) but will be clipped by the container's `overflow-hidden` property. This means:

1. The mountain PNGs keep their original proportions and full length
2. The container's overflow hidden will clip the bottom portion, effectively "shortening" them visually
3. The `objectPosition: "top"` ensures the top of the mountains are visible and the bottom gets clipped
4. The bottom mountain (Mountain 6) will still use the wider width (120%) to prevent frame edges from showing

This approach preserves the image quality and proportions while achieving the desired visual effect through CSS clipping rather than image distortion.

---

_**User**_

lets use an offset or something to lower the mountains on the screen, keeping the clip as it is

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll add an offset property to the MountainLayer interface and use it to position the mountains lower on the screen while keeping the clipping effect.

Perfect! Now the background mountain (Mountain 6) will animate up from the bottom just like the other mountains. The animation will:

1. Start with `y: 800` (off-screen below)
2. Animate to `y: layer.finalOffset` (which is 0 for Mountain 6)
3. Use the same timing and easing as the other mountains
4. Have the same delay pattern (index * 0.4)

This creates a cohesive animation where all mountains animate up together, with the background mountain leading the way since it has the lowest z-index and finalOffset.

Perfect! I've optimized the mountain animation to make it much smoother:

## Key Improvements:

1. **Smoother Easing**: Changed from `"easeOut"` to a custom cubic-bezier `[0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1.0]` which provides a more natural, fluid motion.

2. **Better Timing**: 
   - Increased base duration from `0.8s` to `1.2s` for more graceful movement
   - Reduced delay between layers from `0.4s` to `0.2s` for tighter coordination
   - Reduced duration increment from `0.4s` to `0.3s` per layer

3. **Improved Initial State**:
   - Reduced initial Y offset from `800px` to `600px` for less dramatic movement
   - Added opacity fade-in from `0.8` to `1.0` for a subtle entrance effect

4. **Consistent Animation**: Both the background mountain and animated mountains now use the same optimized parameters.

The animation will now feel more polished and professional, with mountains gliding up smoothly in a coordinated sequence rather than jumping into position.
