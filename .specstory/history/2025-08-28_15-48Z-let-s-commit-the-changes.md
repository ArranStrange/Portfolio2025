okay, lets make sure the about page has the same background as the rest of the app

---

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you check and ensure the About page has the same background as the rest of the app. Let me first examine the current About page and then compare it with other pages to see what background styling is being used.


---

Read file: src/pages/AboutPage.tsx

---

Now let me check the About component to see its current styling:


---

Read file: src/components/About.tsx

---

Now let me check other pages to see what background styling they use. Let me look at the Hero page and Projects page to compare:


---

Read file: src/pages/HeroPage.tsx

---

Read file: src/pages/ProjectsPage.tsx

---

Now let me check the Hero component to see what background it uses:


---

Read file: src/components/Hero.tsx

---

Let me check the Projects component to see its background:


---

Read file: src/components/Projects.tsx

---

Let me check the main App.tsx to see how the overall background is structured:


---

Read file: src/App.tsx

---

Now let me check the CSS to see what background colors are defined:


---

Read file: src/index.css

---

Now let me check the Tailwind config to see what colors are defined:


---

Read file: tailwind.config.js

---

Now I can see the issue! Looking at the code, I can see that:

1. The **main app background** is set in `src/index.css` with `background-color: #0a0e0a` (a very dark green/black)
2. The **About component** has its own background with `bg-charcoal` which is `#1a1a1a` (a lighter gray)
3. Other pages like Hero and Projects don't override the background - they inherit the main app background

The About page is using a different background color (`bg-charcoal`) instead of inheriting the main app background. Let me fix this by removing the custom background from the About component:


---

<details><summary>Edit file: src/components/About.tsx</summary>

    return (
      <section className="min-h-screen relative overflow-hidden">

- 
        {/* Main content container */}
        <div className="relative z-10 min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center section-padding">
```

</details>

---

Perfect! I've removed the custom `bg-charcoal` background from the About component. Now the About page will inherit the same background as the rest of the app, which is the dark green/black color (`#0a0e0a`) with the subtle noise texture defined in the main CSS.

The About page will now have the same consistent background as all other pages in your app. The background includes:
- The main dark color (`#0a0e0a`)
- The subtle noise texture overlay
- The star field, VHS grain, and other atmospheric effects from the main app

This ensures visual consistency across your entire portfolio application.
