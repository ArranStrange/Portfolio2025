# Replace placeholders with Cloudinary images (2025-08-19 12:11Z)

_**User**_

lets addf this cloudinary images to their mathcing projects instead of the placeholder:

@https://res.cloudinary.com/dw6klz9kg/image/upload/v1754162616/home/portfolio/icons/Weather_App.png - weather app

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you update the project images to use the Cloudinary URLs instead of the placeholder images. Let me first examine the current project structure to understand how the images are being used.

Let me search for the Projects component to see how the images are currently implemented:

Read file: src/components/Projects.tsx

---

Now let me check the ProjectsPage to see if there's another implementation:


---

Read file: src/pages/ProjectsPage.tsx

---

Perfect! I can see that the Projects component is using placeholder images. Now I need to update the projects array to use the Cloudinary URLs you provided. Let me map the projects to their corresponding Cloudinary images:

1. VISOR → https://res.cloudinary.com/dw6klz9kg/image/upload/v1754162615/home/portfolio/icons/VISOR.png
2. Sticky Fingers → https://res.cloudinary.com/dw6klz9kg/image/upload/v1754162614/home/portfolio/icons/Sticky_Fingers.png
3. Black Book → https://res.cloudinary.com/dw6klz9kg/image/upload/v1754162613/home/portfolio/icons/Black_Book.png
4. Weather App → https://res.cloudinary.com/dw6klz9kg/image/upload/v1754162616/home/portfolio/icons/Weather_App.png

I notice there's also a "Run Tracker" project that doesn't have a corresponding Cloudinary image, so I'll keep that as a placeholder for now.

Now I need to check if the images are actually being used in the component. Looking at the code, I can see that the `image` property is defined but I don't see it being used in the JSX. Let me check if there's an image display section that I might have missed:

</details>

---

I see that the `image` property is defined in the projects array but it's not actually being used in the component. The current implementation shows a placeholder with mountain silhouettes instead of the actual project images. Let me update the component to display the actual project images:

Perfect! I've successfully updated the Projects component to:

1. **Updated the project images** to use the Cloudinary URLs you provided:
   - VISOR: `https://res.cloudinary.com/dw6klz9kg/image/upload/v1754162615/home/portfolio/icons/VISOR.png`
   - Sticky Fingers: `https://res.cloudinary.com/dw6klz9kg/image/upload/v1754162614/home/portfolio/icons/Sticky_Fingers.png`
   - Black Book: `https://res.cloudinary.com/dw6klz9kg/image/upload/v1754162613/home/portfolio/icons/Black_Book.png`
   - Weather App: `https://res.cloudinary.com/dw6klz9kg/image/upload/v1754162616/home/portfolio/icons/Weather_App.png`

2. **Modified the image display logic** to show the actual project images when they're available (Cloudinary URLs), and fall back to the mountain silhouette placeholder for projects that don't have images yet (like "Run Tracker").

The component now:
- Displays the actual project icons from Cloudinary for the 4 projects you specified
- Maintains the placeholder mountain silhouette for the "Run Tracker" project
- Uses proper responsive styling with `object-cover` to ensure the images look good in the aspect-video container
- Includes proper alt text for accessibility

The images will now be displayed in the project preview section instead of the generic mountain silhouette placeholder!
