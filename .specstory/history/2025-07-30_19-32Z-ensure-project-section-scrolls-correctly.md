# Ensure project section scrolls correctly (2025-07-30 19:32Z)

_**User**_

lets make sure the project section is a down scroll and doesn't move onto the next section until all the projects are scrolled through

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you modify the Projects section to ensure it scrolls through all projects before moving to the next section. Let me first examine the current Projects component to understand its structure.


---

Read file: src/components/Projects.tsx

---

Now let me check the main App component to see how the sections are structured and if there's any scroll behavior already implemented:


---

Read file: src/App.tsx

---

I can see that the current Projects component uses horizontal scrolling with snap points, but it doesn't prevent moving to the next section until all projects are scrolled through. I'll modify the Projects component to implement a vertical scroll behavior that ensures users scroll through all projects before moving to the next section.

Let me update the Projects component:

I'm modifying the Projects component to use vertical scrolling instead of horizontal scrolling, ensuring users scroll through all projects before moving to the next section. I'll add scroll snap behavior and make each project take up the full viewport height.

Perfect! I've successfully modified the Projects component to implement vertical scrolling with snap behavior. Here's what I changed:

## Key Changes Made:

1. **Vertical Scrolling**: Changed from horizontal (`overflow-x-auto`) to vertical scrolling (`overflow-y: auto`)

2. **Snap Behavior**: 
   - Changed from `snap-x snap-mandatory` to `snap-y snap-mandatory`
   - Each project now uses `snap-start` instead of `snap-center`

3. **Full Viewport Height**: 
   - Each project now takes up the full viewport height (`h-screen`)
   - The container is set to `h-screen` with `overflow-hidden`

4. **Layout Adjustments**:
   - Projects are now arranged vertically using `flex-col`
   - Each project is centered vertically within its viewport
   - Added proper spacing and max-width constraints

5. **Scroll Behavior**: 
   - Added `useEffect` to programmatically set scroll snap behavior
   - Ensures smooth snapping between projects

## How It Works:

- Users must scroll through each project completely before moving to the next one
- Each project takes up the full viewport height
- Smooth snap behavior ensures users land exactly on each project
- The scroll behavior is mandatory, so users can't skip projects
- The section header remains visible at the top

The Projects section now behaves like a full-page carousel where users must scroll through all projects vertically before moving to the next section of your portfolio. This creates a more controlled and immersive experience for viewing your projects.

the projects seem to have dissapeared and only visor is showing.

I see the issue! The problem is likely that the scroll container height is being constrained and not allowing all projects to be visible. Let me check the current state and fix this.

Read file: src/components/Projects.tsx

I found the issue! The problem is that the scroll container is being constrained by the section's `h-screen` height, and the header is taking up space, leaving insufficient room for the scroll container. Let me fix this by adjusting the layout:

I'm fixing the layout issue by removing the height constraint from the section and adjusting the scroll container to take up the remaining space after the header, ensuring all projects are visible and scrollable.

Perfect! I've fixed the issue. Here's what was wrong and how I fixed it:

## The Problem:
- The section was constrained to `h-screen` with `overflow-hidden`
- The header was taking up space, leaving insufficient room for the scroll container
- The scroll container was trying to be `100vh` but was being cut off

## The Solution:
1. **Removed height constraint**: Changed section from `h-screen overflow-hidden` to `min-h-screen`
2. **Adjusted scroll container height**: Set it to `calc(100vh - 200px)` to account for the header space
3. **Changed project height**: Each project now uses `h-full` instead of `h-screen` to fit within the available scroll container
4. **Removed manual height setting**: Removed the `container.style.height = "100vh"` from useEffect

## How it works now:
- The section takes up at least the full viewport height
- The header has its own space at the top
- The scroll container takes up the remaining viewport space
- Each project fills the available height of the scroll container
- All 5 projects are now visible and scrollable
- Users must scroll through each project completely before moving to the next section

The projects should now all be visible and you should be able to scroll through each one vertically before moving to the next section of your portfolio!

projects is still not showing.

_**Assistant**_

Let me check the current state of the Projects component and debug this issue. It seems like there might be a layout problem preventing the projects from being visible.
