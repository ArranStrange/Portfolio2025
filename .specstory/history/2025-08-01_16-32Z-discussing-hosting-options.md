I'll help you host your portfolio project. Let me first examine the current project structure and configuration to understand what we're working with.


---

Read file: package.json

---

Read file: vercel.json

---

Read file: vite.config.ts

---

Perfect! I can see you have a React + Vite portfolio project that's already configured for deployment. You have a `vercel.json` file, which suggests you're planning to deploy to Vercel. Let me help you host this project.

Here are the steps to host your portfolio:

## Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

Since you already have a `vercel.json` configuration, Vercel is the easiest option:


---

```bash
cd "/Users/arranstrange/Documents/Coding/Portfolio 2" && npm run build
```

```

> portfolio@0.0.0 build
> tsc -b && vite build

src/App.tsx:6:1 - error TS6133: 'StarField' is declared but its value is never r
ead.

6 import StarField from "./components/StarField";
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Found 1 error.


```

---

I see there's a TypeScript error. Let me fix that first by removing the unused import:


---

Read file: src/App.tsx

---

I can see that `StarField` is imported but not used in the component. Let me remove this unused import:


---

<details><summary>Edit file: src/App.tsx</summary>

undefined

**Chunk 1**
Lines added: undefined, lines removed: 1

  import HeroPage from "./pages/HeroPage";
  import ProjectsPage from "./pages/ProjectsPage";
```

</details>

---

Now let's try building again:


---

```bash
npm run build
```

```
arranstrange@MacBook-Pro-2 Portfolio 2 % npm run build

> portfolio@0.0.0 build
> tsc -b && vite build

Great! The build was successful. Now let's deploy your portfolio. Here are the hosting options:

## Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Easiest)

Since you already have a `vercel.json` configuration, let's deploy to Vercel:


---

```bash
npx vercel --yes
```

```
arranstrange@MacBook-Pro-2 Portfolio 2 % npx vercel --yes

You need to log in to Vercel first. Let me help you with that:


---

```bash
npx vercel login
```

```
arranstrange@MacBook-Pro-2 Portfolio 2 % ^[[200~npx vercel login^[[201~
npx vercel login

I see the Vercel login process was interrupted. Let me provide you with alternative hosting options that don't require immediate authentication:

## Alternative Hosting Options:

### Option 2: Deploy to Netlify


---

```bash
npx netlify-cli --version
```

```
arranstrange@MacBook-Pro-2 Portfolio 2 % npx netlify-cli --version

run host

_**Assistant**_

I'll help you host your portfolio. Let me run the development server so you can see your portfolio locally first, then we can deploy it.


---

```bash
cd "/Users/arranstrange/Documents/Coding/Portfolio 2" && npm run dev
```

---

Perfect! Your development server is now running. You should be able to view your portfolio at `http://localhost:5173` (or whatever port Vite assigns).

Now let's deploy it to a hosting platform. I'll show you a few options:

## Option 1: Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)


---

```bash
cd "/Users/arranstrange/Documents/Coding/Portfolio 2" && npx vercel --yes
```

```
